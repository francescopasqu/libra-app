            My name is Francesco Pasquariello, and I founded Libra to help entrepreneurs and SMEs scale intelligently and sustainably.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-muted">
            With a background in engineering and strategy, I built Libra as a platform where businesses can receive real-time insights, tailored advice, and innovative AI-powered tools to grow smarterâ€”not harder.
